What is a portfolio

A portfolio is a single page site that showcases who you are, what skills you have, and most importantly the work you’ve done.
As a developer, your portfolio is going to be in the form of a website. The main goal of this website is to showcase yourself and your work in the best way possible.
We recommend you to code the portfolio using only CSS (you could use framework like Bootstrap, Materialize, Tailwing only for the structure)


1. What you need to include:

    A profile picture

    A small bio about yourself and what job you are looking for (it’s like an “about me” section where people can learn about you). It could also be a funny bio.

    Your strongest skills and the coding languages you know.

    Your education or certificates, and make sure to show that the skills you learned are relevant to web development and the jobs you desire.

    Links to your Github and Linkedin profile.

    A button to download your resume.

    Projects showcasing your work.

    A contact form.

    Nice transition and animations (not mandatory).


2. What you need to showcase in the project section

Add a section to present all the projects you did. You can also add the projects you did in groups, like the Hackathons.
Include your best and most unique projects to well represent your skill set.

Add the name of your project and a picture

When you click on the project, you could redirect the user to another page or display a dropdown, with this information:

    Why did you choose to build this project? Short description of the project and purpose

    What tools did you use when building this project, and how much time you worked on it?

    What challenged you when making this project?

    What did you learn from making this project?

    Add 2 buttons that redirect to your Github Repo and to your deployed project

    Add screenshots or videos of the project
